# Java Semester Labs

Welcome to the **Java Semester Labs** repository. This collection contains structured Java lab work and exercises assigned throughout the academic semester. The projects are developed using **JDK 25** in a **Visual Studio Code** environment.

## Repository Structure

Each lab is organized into its own dedicated folder:

- **Lab01**: Introduction & Setup
    - `AbsoluteValueCalculator.java`: Calculates the absolute value of a given integer.
    - `DiscountCalculator.java`: Computes the total cost after applying a discount if the amount exceeds a threshold.
    - `GradeCalculator.java`: Determines the grade based on student marks.
    - `RectangleChecker.java`: Checks whether a rectangle is a square or not based on dimensions.

- **Lab02**: Multithreading & Concurrency
    - `BankAccount.java`: Demonstrates thread synchronization using `synchronized` methods for concurrent deposit and withdrawal operations on a shared bank account.
    - `ConcurrentCollectionsDemo.java`: Illustrates the use of `ConcurrentHashMap` and `CopyOnWriteArrayList` with multiple producer-consumer threads for thread-safe collection operations.
    - `ThreadCommunicationDemo.java`: Implements the Producer-Consumer pattern using `wait()` and `notify()` for inter-thread communication with a bounded buffer.

- *(More labs will be added as the semester progresses)*

## Topics Covered

This repository covers a wide range of Java concepts, including but not limited to:

- **Basics**: Syntax, data types, and operators
- **Control Flow**: Conditionals and loops
- **Core Java**: Arrays, Strings, and Methods
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- **Advanced Concepts**: Exception Handling, File I/O, Multithreading

## Updates

This repository is a living document of my semester work. New labs, tasks, and improvements will be pushed regularly as the course advances.
